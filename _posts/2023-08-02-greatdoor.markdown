# A Great Door

*For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.*
<br>*1 Corinthians 16. 9*

<br><br>In writing this verse, Paul expresses both hope and an element of concern for the future. He knows that God has opened up a new and exciting ministry for him, but at the same time recognises that there may be stumbling-blocks in the way by those who are out to work against his ministry.

Perhaps, like me, you are approaching a cross-roads in your life, as one door closes and another opens ahead of you. Perhaps, like me, you know that the new door and opportunity will be met with rejoicing in some quarters, and a less positive response from other quarters.

Coming to this verse this evening in our family prayer time (we have been working our way through 1 Corinthians), I felt God put this verse on my heart. It lines up with what's been happening in recent weeks. I've been seeing new opportunities for ministry opening up, with new spheres of work becoming apparent. It feels like God, in His sovereign grace, has yet more work for me to do. Given how bumpy last year was, this fills me with great joy.

But, of course, we should expect opposition whenever we step out in faith to follow God's path. Satan realises that we are a threat to him whenever we step out in faith, after all, he wants us to follow him, not God!

But take courage, friends, for if God has a plan for you (as He does for us all), He will not allow anyone or anything to stand in our/His way.

In the meantime, we would do well to take Paul's advice to heart:

*Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong*
<br>*1 Corinthians 16. 13*

If you feel God is calling you to do something, then don't hesitate in stepping out, for His ways alone are perfect, and it is only in His Sovereign plan that we can find our happiness and fulfilment. 

God bless,
*Michael*
