Let us pray:

Grant, Almighty God, that as You have such patience with us that You do
not deal with us as our sins deserve, may we not indulge ourselves but
carefully consider how often, and in how many ways, we have provoked
Your anger against us, that we may learn humbly to present ourselves to
You for pardon, and with true repentance implore Your mercy upon us, so
that we may from the heart desire wholly to serve You and submit
ourselves before You. Whether Your providence is difficult or easy to
bear, Lord, may we not flatter ourselves in our indolence and spiritual
laziness, but instead find You to be our kind and bountiful Father,
reconciled to You in and through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen[^1]

In this morning’s reading from the book of Jeremiah we are transported
back to the year 597 BC, to see a vision given to the prophet from the
Lord Himself. The vision related to an invasion which had occurred
between 598 and 597 BC, when the Babylonians (led by King
Nebuchadnezzar) sacked Judah and took many of her people away into
exile. In one of the most specific dates I think I’ve ever found in a
Bible commentary, Biblical scholars believe that ““The city surrendered
to the Babylonians on the fifteenth or sixteenth of March 597 BC”.[^2]

We can read of this in 2 Kings:

> *At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up
> to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. And Nebuchadnezzar king of
> Babylon came up to the city while his servants were besieging it, and
> Jehoiachin the king of Judah gave himself up to the king of Babylon,
> himself and his mother and his servants and his officials and his
> palace officials. The king of Babylon took him prisoner in the eighth
> year of his reign and carried off all the treasures of the house of
> the LORD and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all
> the vessels of gold in the temple of the LORD, which Solomon king of
> Israel had made, as the LORD had foretold. (2 Kgs. 24. 10-13)*

After this surrender, a large number of people were taken away into
captivity in Babylon. These people were:

> *Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, together with the
> officials of Judah, the craftsmen, and the metal workers. (Jer. 24.
> 1)*

With these people in captivity, King Nebuchadnezzar installed a puppet
monarch in the form of Mattaniah, and changed his name to Zedekiah. (2
Kgs. 24. 17) The invasion and captivity, we can read in Jeremiah 25,
took place because of the sins of the people of Judah, so the Lord used
Nebuchadnezzar (whom He describes as “my servant” - 25. 9) to sack the
city and deport its key people, leaving only the poor. Even the king’s
son was taken, he being descended from the line of King David. The
exile, Jeremiah revealed in a later prophetic vision, would last for
seventy years. (25. 12)

However, in the vision in chapter 24, which we heard read, the Lord
showed Jeremiah two baskets of figs, standing before the Temple of the
Lord. It was believed that the Temple was where God manifested
Himself,[^3] so we can understand this to mean that the two baskets of
figs were being well looked over and judged by the Lord in what He was
about to say and do. The two baskets each contained figs, but one basket
contained good figs, and the other rancid or bad ones. The good figs,
said the Lord, represented “the exiles from Judah” (24. 5), whereas the
bad figs (which were “so bad they cannot be eaten” 24. 8) represented
“Zedekiah… his officials, the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this
land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt.” (24. 8)

#### The Good and Sweet Figs

The Lord then goes on to explain how the good figs, the exiles taken
from the land of Judah into captivity in Babylon, had only been taken
into captivity because He had willed it: He had sent them there. (24. 5)

Everything that had happened. The fighting, the destruction, the
ransacking, the exile, had all happened as part of the Lord’s plan to
bring about the people’s repentance. Nebuchadnezzar did not win the
battle because of his strength, but because the Lord was using him.
However, the exiles should be encouraged because, said the Lord, one day
they would return to their native land. One day even the Temple of the
Lord would be rebuilt. This would eventually come to pass, and we can
read of this in Ezra 2, when King Cyrus decided to release the captives
and send them back to their homeland. This change in fortunes, however,
would not come about because of the exiles’ power or because of their
might, but because they would experience a change of heart. God says, “I
will give them a heart to know that I am the LORD…”. (24. 7)

This shows us two things:

Firstly we can recognise that their restoration could only come about
through repentance. The exiled people of Judah could only return to
their homeland once they realised the gravity of their sin and truly
repented. The word repent means to turn around, to change course, and
until the exiles did this, there was no hope for them in the eyes of
God.

We can see something of this in the words of the Prophet Hosea, who
pleaded:

> *Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, for you have stumbled because
> of your iniquity. Take with you words and return to the LORD; (Hos 14.
> 1-2)*

It was the people’s iniquity, their sin, that had caused their
destruction and their stumbling. For too long they had been walking away
from God, and now their sins had caught up with them. If they ever hoped
to return from their enforced exile, they would have to repent and come
to the Lord seeking mercy.

The second thing that we can learn is that this heart of repentance
could only come about thanks to the Lord’s actions in their lives. Note
how God did not say “And they will have a heart to know that I am the
LORD”, but rather “I will give them a heart to know that I am the
LORD…”. (24. 7) It was only through God’s gracious working in the
exiles’ lives that they would find it in their hearts to turn away from
their wickedness and seek forgiveness. Without Him making the first
move, they would have remained in their defiant ways, ever lost to
darkness.

In Deuteronomy, we can find these words:

> *And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of
> your offspring, so that you will love the LORD your God with all your
> heart and with all your soul, that you may live. (Deut. 30. 6)*

It was only through loving the Lord their God that the people could
live, and it was only through the Lord circumcising their hearts (and
the hearts of their offspring) – literally cutting away all that was
sinful and cankerous – that they would ever love the Lord at all. In
Christian theology this concept of God moving first is known as
prevenient grace: it is the teaching that, before we were ever able to
know or love God, He had first to reveal Himself to us and plant that
love in our hearts. This is why some people, try as you might to
evangelise them or encourage them in the Lord, will never respond. It is
not down solely to your bad evangelism, but because the Lord, for
reasons best known only to Him, has not placed the spark of faith in
their hearts. The people of Judah who had been taken away into exile
could not return until they repented, and they could not repent until
the Lord had changed their hearts.

Once the Lord had done this - once the people’s hearts had been turned
and they were truly seeking forgiveness – then they could follow the
pattern laid down and promised in Joel 2:

> *Yet even now,” declares the LORD, “return to me with all your heart,
> with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; and rend your hearts
> and not your garments.” Return to the LORD your God, for He is
> gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in stedfast love;
> and He relents over disaster. (Joel 2. 12-13)*

Reading this promise in the here and now, and indeed perhaps hearing it
shared at the time, the exiles may well have jumped up and down with joy
at the prospect of being returned to their native land. After all, we
all know the sorrow the Psalmist felt when he was in exile:

> *By Babel’s streams we sat and wept,*
>
> *when Sion we thought on.*
>
> *In midst thereof we hang’d our harps*
>
> *the willow-trees upon.*
>
> *For there a song required they,*
>
> *who did us captive bring:*
>
> *Our spoilers call’d for mirth, and said,*
>
> *A song of Sion sing.*
>
> *O how the Lord’s song shall we sing*
>
> *within a foreign land?*
>
> *If thee, Jerus’lem, I forget,*
>
> *skill part from my right hand. (Ps. 137. 1-5 – Scottish Psalter)*

But to focus only on their promised return to Judah would only be to
understand half of the promise. Yes, the promise was certainly that one
day they would again inhabit the land the Lord had given them, but there
was something else. Let’s read the promise again:

> *I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to
> this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down; I will plant
> them, and not uproot them. **I will give them a heart to know that I
> am the Lord, and they shall be my people and I will be their God**,
> **for they shall return to me with their whole heart**. (Jer. 24.
> 6-7)*

Not only did God promise to return them home, but He also promised to
“change them inwardly.”[^4] In many ways this is the most exciting bit
of the promise. Yes, returning to the land is good, but (says John
Calvin) the “much more excellent favour”[^5] is that God would “inwardly
change and reform their hearts, so that they would not only return to
their own country, but would also become a true Church”.[^6]

The exiles, through their enforced time away from the land of Judah,
were being punished for their sinfulness, and were being transformed
more into the likeness of God. On their return they would return with
changed hearts and spirits.

#### The Bad and Sour Figs

Found within the other basket in Jeremiah’s vision were the bad or sour
figs. These figs represented the people who remained and were not taken
off into captivity. These people included the puppet king Mattaniah (who
Nebuchadnezzar had renamed Zedekiah – 2 Kgs. 24. 17), the people left
living in the destroyed city, and those who, on seeing the oncoming
storm, had fled into neighbouring Egypt for safety. These people, said
the Lord, were bad figs, good for nothing but throwing out.

Last Lord’s Day at Dowanvale, I went downstairs into the hall with the
Church Officer and discovered that we had been infested with a plague of
flies. They were flying all around our heads, big black buzzing things
in every direction. We couldn’t work out where they had come from, but
they were crawling up the pillars, settling on the tables and chairs,
and generally causing a great nuisance. Upon further examination we
found that somebody had left a piece of cabbage in the paper recycling
bin, that the fruit flies had somehow got in and laid their eggs within.
When I foolishly opened the bin lid, another swarm of big black flies
buzzed past my head and out into the hall. I am reminded of this when
reading of the bad figs. We don’t know especially why they were bad, but
given that they were (in the vision) apparently standing in the open in
the temple, we can perhaps imagine the flies buzzing around them, the
stench as you went near them. Not the sort of thing that the Lord would
want in His holy place.

Why, then, were these figs so bad? Why, then, were these people so bad?
Was it because they had done anything more sinful than those who were
taken into captivity? Well, the Word of God doesn’t say this anywhere.
But what we can see is that whereas the exiled Judaeans would one day
repent and return to the Lord, these people apparently had no sense of
repentance or guilt for the sins that they had committed. Don’t forget,
it was Judah’s collective, combined, sin which led to the invasion in
the first place. These people shared collective responsibility with
those who had been dragged away into exile. On seeing their friends and
kindred being taken away, these people should have put on sackcloth and
ashes and repented, imploring God to have mercy upon them for their
sinfulness. They should have been shaken from their spiritual apathy and
returned to the Lord, but they didn’t.

Those who were left assumed, because they weren’t taken into exile, that
they had been spared. ‘Surely the favour of the Lord is upon us,’ they
may well have said.

And yet, friends, spared they were not.

We can read what happened only a little later in 2 Kings. It is quite
long, but let’s read it together:

> *And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth
> day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his
> army against Jerusalem and laid siege to it. And they built siegeworks
> all around it. So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King
> Zedekiah. On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so
> severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
> Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by
> night by the way of the gate between the two walls, by the king’s
> garden, and the Chaldeans were around the city. And they went in the
> direction of the Arabah. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the
> king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was
> scattered from him. Then they captured the king and brought him up to
> the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they passed sentence on him. They
> slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes
> of Zedekiah and bound him in chains and took him to Babylon.*
>
> *In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month—that was the
> nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan,
> the captain of the bodyguard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came
> to Jerusalem. And he burned the house of the LORD and the king’s house
> and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down. And
> all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard,
> broke down the walls around Jerusalem. And the rest of the people who
> were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king
> of Babylon, together with the rest of the multitude, Nebuzaradan the
> captain of the guard carried into exile. But the captain of the guard
> left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.*
>
> *And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the
> stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the
> Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried the bronze to Babylon. And they
> took away the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the dishes for
> incense and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service, the
> fire pans also and the bowls. What was of gold the captain of the
> guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver. As for the
> two pillars, the one sea, and the stands that Solomon had made for the
> house of the LORD, the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight.
> The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and on it was a
> capital of bronze. The height of the capital was three cubits. A
> latticework and pomegranates, all of bronze, were all around the
> capital. And the second pillar had the same, with the latticework.*
>
> *And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and
> Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the threshold;
> and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the
> men of war, and five men of the king’s council who were found in the
> city; and the secretary of the commander of the army, who mustered the
> people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were
> found in the city. And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them
> and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. And the king of
> Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land
> of Hamath. So Judah was taken into exile out of its land.*
>
> *(2 Kings 25. 1-21)*

God was true to His word. Those who remained, who did not repent and
change their ways, became “a reproach, a byword, a taunt, and a curse”
(Jer. 24. 9). Incidentally each of these four words has has its own
special significance. Each of them looked back to a time in the life of
the people of Israel, and each of them should have served as a warning
to those who remained. Calvin explains it by saying, “The meaning of
this vision is, that there was no reason for the ungodly to flatter
themselves if they continued in their wickedness, though God did bear
with them for a time.”[^7]

#### What kind of fig are you?

This leads me to ask myself, and indeed ask you, what kind of fig you
and I are. I suspect that, had you and I been among those who remained
in Judah after the Babylonians took some of our fellow countrymen away
into exile, we would have turned to each other, wiped our brows, and
breathed a sigh of relief that we had not been taken. I suspect we, like
those who remained, would not have seen the signs, we would have
remained ignorant to the warning that the Lord had given.

Even though the Lord had given warning after warning, culminating in the
ultimate warning or sign of having the city sacked by a foreign power
and allowing part of the nation to be taken into exile, those who
remained were stubborn. They “had not ceased to add sins to sins”.[^8]
The events which should have served as a great warning to those who
remained were soon forgotten, as the people continued to get on with
their own lives, with no interest in what the Lord had said. The Lord
warned Jeremiah this would happen, and as we heard, only a few years
later the ultimate destruction came to pass.

Dear friends, if you see bad things happening around you, I beseech you
not to allow yourself to fall into a cool complacency, think “I’m
alright, Jack” and get on as though nothing had happened.

If, however, you and I had been among those taken into exile in Babylon,
we may well have thought that all was lost, that there was no hope for
us and our descendents. We were rightly being punished for our sins and
there was nothing more for it. And yet this was far from the case. Yes,
the people were facing God’s punishment for their sins, but there was a
great hope ahead of them. In fact, this time of affliction was all part
of the Lord’s sovereign plan to lead them back into their land, and back
into relationship with Him. God had His hand on all that was going on:
He had used Nebuchadnezzar for His purposes and had a plan for the
exiled community. By turning their hearts to repentance, the Lord was
giving the exiles the prompt they needed to return to Him in repentance.

The phrase ‘providence’ which we often use to describe the Lord’s will
often has very positive and almost cuddly connotations; and yet this
passage of Scripture shows us that sometimes the Lord’s providence can
at times be quite difficult to bear. And perhaps there are those among
us this morning who can attest to this truth. Indeed, in my own life I
have undergone some difficult points in my Christian walk, and yet it is
only upon looking back that I realise how the Lord not only had His hand
on me, but was actually using the difficult situation (and those who
were causing me such distress) as His servants, just like He used
Nebuchadnezzar the King. Perhaps, as we think on this, we can consider
the lives of Daniel and Joseph, both men who were either forced or sold
into exile and slavery, and yet in both cases the Lord used them
mightily. Joseph, when the end of his life was drawing near, was even
given the grace to say to his brothers that, while they meant their
actions for evil, “God meant \[them\] for good.” (Gen. 50. 21) If you
are in the midst of a difficult trial this morning, it is worth
reminding yourself that **all things** are in God’s hands, and whether
we understand it now, or not, when we come before Him face to face, all
things will be revealed and His providential love in our lives will make
all things clear.

Perhaps too we can remember the all too familiar words of Psalm 23,
reminding ourselves how, in verse four, the Lord is with His sheep even
in “the valley of the shadow of death”. (Ps. 23. 4) Note how He does not
stop us going into the valley, nor does He swoop in and remove us, but
instead walks through alongside us – the King of love alongside us as a
friend and travelling-companion.

Another truth we can learn from this passage concerns those who, in this
life, commit acts of great cruelty and sin, and yet who appear to get
away with it. I am sure that we can all imagine such people, and that
each of us has, at some point or other, asked God ‘How come You let
so-and-so get away with this?’ Just because God does not immediately
reward us according to our deeds, just because God does not immediately
settle scores, we can see from this passage that those who continue in
sin will not escape Divine justice.

Jeremiah’s vision of the good and bad, the sweet and sour, figs is a
startling reminder for us that, with God, all is not as it may seem. The
bad figs were the ones who, in earthly terms at least, seemed to have
all the luck. They were not taken away in bondage into captivity, but
instead survived the attack and were left in their homeland. As they
waved goodbye to their countrymen, they may have felt very pleased with
themselves, and yet their luck was up. Those good figs, however, were
those who suffered in this life but were ultimately rewarded with both
restoration to their home-land, but restoration with the Lord by the
renewing of their hearts.

Many good Christian people will, in this life, suffer great adversity,
but God has a purpose that will ultimately work to their good, for “we
know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for
those who are called according to His purpose.” (Rom. 8. 28) What may
have appeared to be a catastrophe would ultimately be seen as a
blessing. We should not, therefore, be overwhelmed when apparent
calamity overtakes us, but instead remember how the Lord can and does
use such situations for good.[^9] Let us always trust in His
providential love, which He promises us in the person of Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory now and forever.

Let us pray:

Grant, Almighty God, that as You have placed us in this world and daily
pour upon us blessing upon blessing, that we may live lives hastening
towards our ultimate goal. Grant that Your blessings may not become
hindrances to us through our misusing or misunderstanding of them, but
instead may teach us to love and praise You, and to appreciate Your
mercy. May we ever know You as our God, and strive on our part to
present ourselves to You as Your people, and consecrate ourselves to
You, that Your name may be glorified in us, through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.[^10]
