<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><i>	“But if anyone does sin,
we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He
is the propitiation for our sins”.</i><span style="font-style: normal"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a>
Thus reads one of the most encouraging promises in Scripture, the
assurance that, if and when we sin, Jesus Christ will intercede with
the Father on our behalf, and that “</span><i>by His wounds, [we]
are healed</i><span style="font-style: normal">.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a></span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	Our
reading this morning comes from the First Letter of John. This
letter, believed to have been written by the Beloved Disciple who, at
the Last Supper, reclined on Jesus’ breast,<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a>
is a letter of encouragement and instruction to believers. However,
in order to understand it fully, we need to engage in a bit of
‘mirror reading’, or ‘reading between the lines’.</span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	What is going on in the
Church to which John is writing?</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">1)	In
1.1, John writes about the “</span><i>[The life] which was from the
beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes,
which we looked upon and have touched with our hands”.</i><span style="font-style: normal"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote4anc" href="#sdfootnote4sym"><sup>4</sup></a>
This instruction which he is sending to the church is nothing new.
They have already heard the Good News of Jesus Christ, indeed some of
them may even have encountered Jesus as He walked the earth. Here
John is setting the tone – ‘You already know all this, but I am
just going to go through it with you again’.</span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">2)
In 2.7, he explains that he is “</span><i>writing to you no new
commandment, but an old commandment that you had from the
beginning</i><span style="font-style: normal">”.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym"><sup>5</sup></a>
Again, this is nothing novel that he is writing.</span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	But why would he need to
write reiterating well-ken truths?</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	We
can find our answer further on in chapter 2: “</span><i>They went
out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us,
they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might
become plain that they all are not of us.</i><span style="font-style: normal">”,<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote6anc" href="#sdfootnote6sym"><sup>6</sup></a>
and “</span><i>I write to you, not because you do not know the
truth, but because you know it”</i><span style="font-style: normal">.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote7anc" href="#sdfootnote7sym"><sup>7</sup></a>
What is clear is that people, perhaps even believers, perhaps even
church leaders, have walked away from the faith of Jesus Christ and,
in so doing, have led others astray.</span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	John
continues: “</span><i>I write these things to you about those who
are trying to deceive you”.</i><span style="font-style: normal"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote8anc" href="#sdfootnote8sym"><sup>8</sup></a>
The believers in this place have not just wandered astray, but appear
to have been deliberately led astray. The relevance of this will
become clear as we proceed through. But this is a letter calling the
scattered sheep back into the fold, and helping them identify wolves
within their midst.</span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	So, having considered what is
going on in the place that John is writing to, let’s consider what
he is actually sending them in these six verses. Why is he taking the
trouble to write?</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	We
find a mixture of encouragement and instruction: “</span><i>I am
writing these things to you so that you may not sin”</i><span style="font-style: normal"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote9anc" href="#sdfootnote9sym"><sup>9</sup></a>
- the instructional element – and </span><i>“But if anyone does
sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
He is the propitiation for our sins”</i><span style="font-style: normal"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote10anc" href="#sdfootnote10sym"><sup>10</sup></a>
- the encouraging element.  </span></font>
</p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	There,
in the first verse of our reading, we have our answer to what he was
sending. So perhaps I needn’t say any more!</span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	I believe, in order to
understand the passage fully, we need to grapple with two key
theological terms. These are terms that don’t tend to be used in
everyday speech, but are essential if we are to understand the
reading.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	There are some who do not
think we should use special theological language because it makes
Christianity inaccessible to those outwith. While I can see this line
of argument, sometimes the vernacular or language we employ in our
everyday lives is just not up to adequately explaining what we read
in our Bibles. Sometimes we need the language of Scripture to fully
expound these truths.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	So,
our first theological word: </span><i>advocate</i><span style="font-style: normal">.
The likelihood is that you have at least heard, if not used, this
word before. In our Scottish legal system we have </span><i>advocates</i><span style="font-style: normal">.
</span></font>
</p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	In
Scotland there are two very senior Law officers, the Lord Advocate
and the Solicitor General. These two ladies are “the principal
legal advisers to the Scottish Government”,<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote11anc" href="#sdfootnote11sym"><sup>11</sup></a>
offering advice and support in all legal matters. Meanwhile, at a
much lower level, up and down our nation, every day </span><i>advocates</i><span style="font-style: normal">
stand up in our court houses, cross examining witnesses and
defendants and either working for the defence or the prosecution –
fulfilling similar roles to English barristers.</span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	The
dictionary describes an advocate as “a person who upholds or
defends a cause or cause of action”,<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote12anc" href="#sdfootnote12sym"><sup>12</sup></a>
and this makes sense given what we know of the legal advocate’s
job. However, what about the jump to the theological?</span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	John
writes that “</span><i>we have an advocate with the Father</i><span style="font-style: normal">”.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote13anc" href="#sdfootnote13sym"><sup>13</sup></a>
If we were to apply the legal image I outlined a moment ago here, we
can perhaps see what I am alluding to. You see, God has righteous
laws, unalterable rules with which He rules the world and sets
humanity its boundaries. These laws are not there to work as a
straight-jacket, but are there to protect us. However, time and time
again we break these rules, we sin against Him and challenge  His law
of love. </span></font>
</p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	If
God was to challenge us on these infractions of His law, as we are
promised at the Day of Judgement, we would be found guilty on all
counts. As we can read in Romans, “</span><i>all have sinned and
fall short of the glory of God”.</i><span style="font-style: normal"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote14anc" href="#sdfootnote14sym"><sup>14</sup></a>
None of us would pass the test, all would fail. And, as we can read
throughout the New Testament, the only just punishment for such a
transgression of God’s law is hell – for God and sin cannot
co-exist – 1 Corinthians makes this very clear “</span><i>the
unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God</i><span style="font-style: normal">”.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote15anc" href="#sdfootnote15sym"><sup>15</sup></a></span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	However,
as John explains to us, all is not lost. Thanks to His incredible
grace, God has provided the answer to this problem. Jesus stands as
our advocate. “</span><i>He pleads our case with the Righteous
Judge. We may imagine the conversation going something like this:
“Father, I know this one has sinned and violated our commands. He
is guilty as charged. However, you have said that my sacrifice is
sufficient payment for the debt he owes. My righteousness was applied
to his account when he trusted in me for salvation and forgiveness. I
have paid the price, so he can be pronounced ‘Not guilty.’ There
is no debt left for him to pay””.</i><span style="font-style: normal"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote16anc" href="#sdfootnote16sym"><sup>16</sup></a></span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	Those
of you unfortunate enough to have experienced the legal system will
know that, in order to receive legal assistance, you have to ask for
it. You have to approach someone and ask for their help; and this is
no different for Jesus. In order for Him to work in our hearts and
become our advocate, we need to ask Him into our lives. Once we do
this, Jesus is ready to plead our cause – as the hymn goes, “</span><i>For
lo, between our sins and their reward, we set the passion of Thy Son
our Lord”</i><span style="font-style: normal">.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote17anc" href="#sdfootnote17sym"><sup>17</sup></a></span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	So,
Jesus is our mediator and advocate, ready so stand for us at the day
of Judgement. We know that Jesus said “</span><i>I came that they
may have life and have it abundantly”</i><span style="font-style: normal"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote18anc" href="#sdfootnote18sym"><sup>18</sup></a>
- but even with Jesus as our advocate, how do we get from guilty to
not guilty? For this, we need to consider our second theological word
– Jesus is “</span><i>the propitiation for our sins</i><span style="font-style: normal">”.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote19anc" href="#sdfootnote19sym"><sup>19</sup></a></span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	Put
simply, the word propitiation means ‘satisfaction’. “It means
that Christ, in His perfect life and atoning, substitutionary death,
that He satisfied the wrath of God against our sin and against us. It
wasn't that He simply satisfied or assuaged God's wrath against sin;
He assuaged God's wrath against us. ”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote20anc" href="#sdfootnote20sym"><sup>20</sup></a></span></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	We see this in the
Westminster Confession where, in Chapter VIII, we can read:</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	</span><i>The
Lord Jesus, by His perfect obedience and sacrifice of 	Himself, which
he through the eternal Spirit once offered up 	unto God, hath fully
satisfied the justice of His Father; and 	purchased not only
reconciliation, but an everlasting 	inheritance in the kingdom of
Heaven, for all those whom the 	Father hath given unto Him.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote21anc" href="#sdfootnote21sym"><sup>21</sup></a></i></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	A way of understanding
Christ’s act of propitiation is to imagine a judge. Before him
stands a case of some nature, and the defendant is found guilty. The
punishment on the statute books, in this case is a fine, and so the
judge is bound to issue the fine – that is what the law demands of
him. If he decided not to issue the fine,  it would make a mockery of
the law, and he is not prepared to do that. However, the judge has
compassion on the person. Because the judge is graceful and merciful,
he doesn’t want to sentence the man to a fine that he knows he’ll
not be able to cope with. So he does something amazing – he issues
the fine, as the law demands, but then gets out his chequebook and
writes a cheque to settle the debt. Therefore the law is satisfied –
the fine is levied – but the defendant is not saddled with a debt
he could never hope to pay.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	In Jesus’ death on the
cross, He suffered the punishment that we all deserved. Don’t
forget, Christ lived a perfect life. He never put a foot wrong and
kept the Law to the letter. In fact, we can read that Christ came not
“<i>to abolish [the Law and the Prophets], but to fulfil them</i>”.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote22anc" href="#sdfootnote22sym"><sup>22</sup></a>
Jesus did not deserve to die and suffer the way He did. He didn’t
deserve to endure God’s wrath. But, because of God’s immense love
for mankind, He sacrificed Himself (for remember that the Father and
the Son are One) to wipe our slates clean. </font>
</p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	On the day of Judgement, He
will say to God Almighty those words I’ve already shared, “<i>My
righteousness was applied to his account when he trusted in me for
salvation and forgiveness. I have paid the price, so he can be
pronounced ‘Not guilty.’ There is no debt left for him to pay”.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote23anc" href="#sdfootnote23sym"><sup>23</sup></a></i></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><i>	</i><b>Our reading,
therefore, gives us the answer to the problem of our sin, and how it
divides us from God.</b> Until Jesus came, there was no hope, for the
great chasm between mankind and God was so great that nobody would
ever have been able to cross it. In Jesus’ death, He became our
propitiation, bridging the chasm and drawing us back into God’s
realm.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	But the reading does more
than explain this (as if this wasn’t enough!) For John goes on to
offer us two yardsticks.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	The first yardstick is for us
to use introspectively. We can find this yardstick in vv3 and 6. “<i>And
by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His
commandments… whoever says he abides in Him ought to walk in the
same way in which He walked”.</i><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote24anc" href="#sdfootnote24sym"><sup>24</sup></a></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	These verses help us identify
where we are in our faith walk. While it is important, essential
even, to remember that it is not by our works that we get to heaven
(as I’ve explained, it is all thanks to Jesus in His twin roles as
advocate and propitiation), it is also important we consider our
response to Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross. The Letter of James
explains this well. Here James deals with the question of whether we
need to show works if it is our faith in God’s grace that saves us.
He says that “<i>faith apart from works is useless”</i>,<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote25anc" href="#sdfootnote25sym"><sup>25</sup></a>
that it is a sure sign of a dry, straw-like religious observance to
see people trusting in God’s grace but not outworking Jesus’
example in their lives. After all, we should ask ourselves, ‘If
Jesus has done all of this for me, is there anything I am being
prompted to change for Him?’ - not <b>for</b> our salvation, but as
a grateful response <b>to</b> it!</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	So too, returning to 1 John,
we have the instruction “<i>whoever says he abides in [Jesus] ought
to walk in the same way in which He walked”.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote26anc" href="#sdfootnote26sym"><sup>26</sup></a>
</i>If we identify with Jesus, we should keep His rules. A little
like, if we belong to an organisation and wish to enjoy its benefits,
we should observe the organisation’s rules. We don’t do this to
get the benefits, but out of respect to the organisation. So too, we
don’t walk in Jesus’ way to get something out of Him, but out of
respect and thanks for all that He has done for us.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	The second yardstick is to
help us clearly identify other people, and work out their walk with
God. As I mentioned at the beginning, the people to whom John was
writing had been led away by false leaders. Their experience is not
unique – across the world, Sunday by Sunday, there are false
leaders standing up in some churches who are leading people away from
Christ. This is a problem as much today as it was 2,000 years ago.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	So, what can we do? Well,
says John, “<i>Whoever says, ‘I know Him’, but does not keep
His commandments is a liar.”</i><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote27anc" href="#sdfootnote27sym"><sup>27</sup></a>
The same criteria by which we judge our own faith can be used to
identify false leaders, wolves in sheep’s clothing. We can look at
the actions of other people within the Church and determine whether
they are keeping God’s laws. And, if they aren’t, we can be
fairly certain that either they have been led astray (and need
shepherding back in to the fold), or they are (to quote John), a liar
and shouldn’t be followed.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	Now, of course, it is
important for us to remember that the sinful human nature being as it
is, it is always tempting to judge other people based on their
actions. It is important, as ever, to take circumstances into
account. An otherwise upright Christian who takes a stumble, or makes
a mistake, is not the kind of person that John calls a liar. We are
no better than they are – for they have made a mistake in just the
same way we so frequently do. However, for example, the Church leader
who acts or lives in a way utterly contrary to the Bible, it is this
kind of person that John has set his sights on. They are the ones we
should watch out for.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	<b>So what can we take from
our Scripture reading today</b>? What can we apply to our lives to
shape our Christian walk?</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	We can remember that,
considering v4, there is an inferred expectation that we will keep
Jesus’ commandments. As I’ve said, we do not observe Jesus’
commands because we want to get into heaven or experience His favour,
but <b>because</b> He has already done so much for us that we want to
please Him and give Him the glory.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	Furthermore, as we saw in v6,
there is an inferred expectation that we abide in Him. We all know
the old hymn, <i>Abide with me<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote28anc" href="#sdfootnote28sym"><sup>28</sup></a></i>
– this isn’t that. We aren’t asking Jesus to stay with us, as
the hymn is. It isn’t even Jesus asking us to stay with Him. Rather
to abide <b>in</b> Jesus means to rely on Him, to live through Him,
and allow Him to live <b>in</b> us. It means to see the world as He
does, to have compassion as He does. Additionally, as we’ll
consider in a moment, to abide in Jesus, to “<i>dwell[s] in the
shelter of the Most High… [and] abide in the shadow of the
Almighty</i>”,<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote29anc" href="#sdfootnote29sym"><sup>29</sup></a>
is all we can hope to do when comes the Day of Judgement.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	A question that it is
important to consider at this point can be found in v3 – “<i>And
by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His
commandments”</i>.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote30anc" href="#sdfootnote30sym"><sup>30</sup></a>
Are we to read from this that, if we fail to keep His commandments,
we are not Christians? One theologian, explaining this, writes that,</font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">	<i>In the Greek world, [John]
was faced with people who saw 	God as an intellectual exercise and
who could say, ‘I know 	God’  without being conscious of any
ethical obligation 	whatever. In the Greek world he was faced with
people who 	had an emotional experience and who could say, ‘I am in
	God and God is in me’, and who did not see God in terms of
	commandments at all.</i></font></p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><i>	John is determined to lay
it down quite unmistakably and 	without compromise that the only way
in which we can show 	that we know God is by obedience to Him, and
the only way 	we can show that we have union with Christ is by
imitation of 	Him. Christianity is the religion which offers the
greatest 	privilege and brings with it the greatest obligation.
	Intellectual effort and emotional experience are not neglected 	–
far from it – but they must combine to issue in moral 	action.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote31anc" href="#sdfootnote31sym"><sup>31</sup></a></i></font></p>

<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><i>	</i>As with so many
things, friends, what is at issue here is not what we do, but our
motives behind them. You and I are Christians, not because we turn up
at Church Sunday by Sunday; not because we say our prayers or because
we feed the hungry. We are Christians because we have opened our
hearts to Jesus Christ, and because God determined to reveal Himself
to us before the foundation of the world. While I am not condoning
sin for one moment, the occasional slip-up on our part is not going
to call that into question – because God can see far past the oft
idiotic or misguided actions we take, and see into our hearts. We
remain children of God when we slip up. Indeed, the authors of the
Westminster Confession wrote at length on <i>The Perseverance of the
Saints –</i> the theological concept explaining why, even when we
sin, we don’t fall away from the state of grace that Christ gives
us - in chapter 17 of the <i>Confession</i>:</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">	</span></span><i>This
perseverance of the saints depends, not upon their own 	free will,
but upon the immutability of the decree of election, 	flowing from
the free and unchangeable love of God the 	Father; upon the efficacy
of the merit and intercession of 	Jesus Christ; the abiding of the
Spirit and of the seed of God 	within them; and the nature of the
covenant of grace: from 	all which ariseth also the certainty and
infallibility thereof.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote32anc" href="#sdfootnote32sym"><sup>32</sup></a></i></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><i>	</i><span style="font-style: normal">Put
simply, if we believe that we are saved by God’s grace, as part of
His sovereign will, it is ludicrous for us to believe that we are
able to wriggle free of His grasp! Our salvation is all on Him, and
our failings don’t come into it!</span></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	Lastly,
and perhaps the most important takeaway message of all, it is
important that we remember the role of an advocate and see the
relevance in our lives. In a courtroom it is the advocate that speaks
and, apart from when under questioning, we as the defendant remain
silent. Indeed, if we try to speak out of place, the Judge is well
within his rights to cry, ‘Silence in court’! Just as the
defendant in court depends on his advocate representing him, we
depend all the more on Jesus as our mediator and advocate in heaven,
representing us to the Father Almighty. We depend not on our own
skill or goodness, our own performance in the dock, our own
achievements or faith, but upon His unblemished record and unbroken
success rate.</span></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-style: normal">	Friends,
let us this day recognise the supreme importance of Jesus as our
advocate and representative – our representative in the courtroom
advocate when comes the Day of Judgement, and our representative on
the cross of Calvary, where He bled and died for our sins and the
sins of the world, offering Himself as the propitiation for our sins,
that we may be fully clothed in Him and washed clean in His blood. </span></font>
