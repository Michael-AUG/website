# But what do I believe?
Well, the answer to that is fairly simple - I believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God and that we add to it or subtract from it at our peril.

Ever since the earliest days of the church, Christians have laid out their beliefs in brief ‘creeds’ or ’confessions’ in an attempt to summarise essential Christian truths and to guard the church from error. These statements are always secondary to the Bible but they are enormously helpful. 

At my ordination as an office-bearer in the Church, I have formally affirmed that I "sincerely own and declare the Congession of Faith, approven by former General Assemblies of [the] Church, to be the confession of [my] faith; and [that] I own the doctrine therein contained to be the true doctrine, which [I] will constantly adhere to." (Extract from 'Questions put to Office-bearers', Manual of Practice of the Associated Presbyterian Church of Scotland)


# The Westminster Confession of Faith (1647)

You can find the Confession on the [Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland](https://www.fpchurch.org.uk/about-us/important-documents/the-westminster-confession-of-faith/) website. It is quite a long read but, I think, worth it. Alongside the Westminster Confession, there are sister documents (such as the [Shorter](https://thewestminsterstandard.org/westminster-shorter-catechism/) and [Larger](https://thewestminsterstandard.org/westminster-larger-catechism/) Catechisms, the [Directory for Public Worship](https://www.fpchurch.org.uk/about-us/important-documents/the-directory-for-public-worship/) and the [Directory for Family Worship](https://www.fpchurch.org.uk/about-us/important-documents/the-directory-for-family-worship/)) which can also help clarify our faith.
