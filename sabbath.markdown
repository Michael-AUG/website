**Today is Sunday - the Christian Sabbath**

On Sunday, Christians particularly recall Jesus' rising from the dead. Because of this, Sunday is set aside as a day of worship and praise, rest and family time. 

This website is closed on Sundays to help you to observe the Sabbath as well.

*Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.*
*Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:*
*But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work.*
(From Exodus 20. 8-10)

For a more detailed explanation of why Christians mark the Sabbath, see the below extract from the Westminster Confession (1647)


<p>8. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men, after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe an holy rest, all the day, from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly employments, and recreations,<sup>o</sup> but also are taken up the whole time in the public
and private exercises of His worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.<sup>p</sup></p><p><sup>o</sup><a href="https://av1611.com/verseclick/gobible.php?p=Exod_20.8" class="vcVerseLink" target="_blank"
