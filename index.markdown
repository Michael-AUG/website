Welcome to my website, the purpose of which is to share my sermons with those who are interested in hearing them. My wife (Jacqueline) and I are members of the Associated Presbyterian Church, Stornoway, and it is my privilege to preach the Gospel fairly frequently. Although I trained for ministry in a previous denomination (which I left on theological grounds), I am not a minister of the Gospel, but preach as one who ["intend[s] the ministry" - see here](https://thewestminsterstandard.org/directory-for-the-publick-worship-of-god/#3).

The name of this website is a reference to the words of Romans 10. 14:
> How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? 
> and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? 
> and how shall they hear without a preacher?

Alongside my sermons, you will find a few articles I've written, and a brief introduction to one of my other hobbies: collecting Communion Tokens.

In line with my views on Sabbath-keeping, this website is closed on the Lord's Day, reopening on Monday.

I hope that this website is a blessing to you, and that the Lord will speak to you through what you read or hear.

God bless <br>
Michael
