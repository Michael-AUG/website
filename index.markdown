My name is Michael and I live just south of Glasgow with my wife, Jackie, hail from Essex, and study Divinity at the University of Glasgow. I have been a preacher since 2018, and have been married to Jackie since 2021.

In my studies I have a particular interest in Reformation Theology, Church History, Presbyterian Practice, the role of the Church in 21st century Scotland and what Neurodiversity means to Christianity. My academic writing can be viewed on [my Academia page](https://glasgow.academia.edu/MichaelRJTopple). Alongside my studies, I am in the process of learning Gàidhlig (Scottish Gaelic) - *tha beagan Gàidhlig agam*.

I am a Fellow or Member of various Antiquarian and Theological Societies, and in my spare time enjoy [amateur radio](https://gm5aug.topple.scot), and driving my classic and vintage cars.

The title of this blog comes from the Psalms, Psalm 71 in particular. I think of this Psalm as "the preacher's Psalm" because of the Psalmist's cry to God:

*O God, do not forsake me, until I proclaim Your might to another generation, Your power to all those to come*
(Psalm 71. 18)

From a young age I felt God's call to ministry. Since then, I have found myself in a number of dead ends, "*in a dry and thirsty land, where there is no water*" (to again quote the Psalmist - Psa. 63. 1). On each occasion, I had initially believed the Lord had called me to that place, situation and ministry, on each occasion I had thrown myself entirely into that situation, and on each occasion was proven wrong - that this was not where God wanted me. Yet these ups and downs have shown me that, when God has a plan for you (as He does for each of us), no number of wrong turns on our part will scupper His plan. It has taught me the difference between good ideas and God ideas, has shown me the importance of serious prayer and time with the Lord when seeking to discern His paths, and has also shown me that what **I think** I need may not be what **He knows** I need.

Through all of this, though, I can say with John Newton:

*...'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
and grace will lead me home.'*
(Amazing Grace - John Newton)

This promise can be yours too, if you let God in to your life.

God bless,
*Michael*
