Hello! My name is Michael and I live in Scotland with my wife, Jackie, hail from Essex, and study Divinity at the University of Glasgow. I have been a preacher since 2018, and was ordained an Elder in 2020 (although as of May 2023 am not serving as an Elder). Jackie and I married in 2021.

In my studies I have a particular interest in Reformation Theology, Church History, Presbyterian Practice, the role of the Church in 21st century Scotland and what Neurodiversity means to Christianity. My academic writing can be viewed on [my Academia page](https://glasgow.academia.edu/MichaelRJTopple).

I am a Fellow or Member of various Antiquarian and Theological Societies, and in my spare time enjoy [amateur radio](https://gm5aug.topple.scot), and driving my classic and vintage cars. I have Asperger syndrome which I consider to be a gift from God, even if it can make my life a bit more complicated.

The title of this blog comes from the New Testament book 1 Timothy, chapter 4 verse 12, where the writer tells Timothy to let nobody look down on him because of his νεότητος (pronounced neo-tay-tos), or 'youth', because God has called him regardless of his age. I find this passage of Scripture an inspiration that has given me cause to pause and reflect on my personal sense of call to ministry - even though this ministry has not taken the form I once believed God wished it to. 

I do not intend this blog to be focussed solely on me, nor solely focussed on my vocation experience, although these will feature heavily. Instead it is intended to be a record of one young man's walk with God, and prove a source of inspiration to others.

In presenting this website I do not pretend to claim any special insight or intellect, but pray that as God inspired Timothy so too the words of my lips may be His words to our generation.

God bless,
*Michael*
