My name is Michael and I live just south of Glasgow with my wife, Jackie, hail from Essex, and study Divinity at the University of Glasgow. I have been a preacher since 2018, and have been married to Jackie since 2021.

In my studies I have a particular interest in Reformation Theology, Church History, Presbyterian Practice, the role of the Church in 21st century Scotland and what Neurodiversity means to Christianity. My academic writing can be viewed on [my Academia page](https://glasgow.academia.edu/MichaelRJTopple). Alongside my studies, I am in the process of learning Gàidhlig (Scottish Gaelic) - *Fàilte gu mo làrach-lìn* - welcome to my website.

I am a Fellow or Member of various Antiquarian and Theological Societies, and in my spare time enjoy [amateur radio](https://gm5aug.topple.scot), and driving my classic and vintage cars.

The title of this blog comes from the Psalms, Psalm 71 in particular. I think of this Psalm as "the preacher's Psalm" because of the Psalmist's cry to God:

*O God, do not forsake me, until I proclaim Your might to another generation, Your power to all those to come*
(Psalm 71. 18)

In these pages you can find my sermons and reflections, read more about my faith, discover more about Jesus, see my collection of communion tokens  and follow links to the various organisations I am a part of. I hope you find something of interest.

God bless,
*Michael*
