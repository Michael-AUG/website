Welcome to my website, the purpose of which is to share my sermons with those who are interested in hearing them. It is my privilege to be a Christian, a Deacon in [Dowanvale Free Church of Scotland](https://www.dowanvale.org), and a lay preacher across the Presbytery. My paid employment is working as the Church Administrator at Dowanvale, while my wife Jacqueline volunteers as the Church Treasurer. Alongside my work I study part time with the [Edinburgh Theological Seminary](https://www.ets.ac.uk), having previously read for my BD (Bachelor of Divinity) degree at the [University of Glasgow](https://glasgow.ac.uk).

The name of this website is a reference to the words of Romans 10. 14:

> How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed?
> And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard?
> And how are they to hear without someone preaching? (ESV)

Alongside my sermons, you will find a few articles I've written, and a brief introduction to one of my other hobbies: collecting Communion Tokens.

I hope that this website is a blessing to you, and that the Lord will speak to you through what you read or hear.

God bless <br>
Michael
